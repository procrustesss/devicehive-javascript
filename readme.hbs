#DeviceHive JavaScript framework

[DeviceHive]: http://devicehive.com "DeviceHive framework"
[DataArt]: http://dataart.com "DataArt"
[DeviceHive RESTful protocol]: http://www.devicehive.com/restful "DeviceHive RESTful protocol"

[DeviceHive] turns any connected device into the part of Internet of Things.
It provides the communication layer, control software and multi-platform
libraries to bootstrap development of smart energy, home automation, remote
sensing, telemetry, remote control and monitoring software and much more.

Connect embedded Linux using Python or C++ libraries and JSON protocol or
connect AVR, Microchip devices using lightweight C libraries and BINARY protocol.
Develop client applications using HTML5/JavaScript, iOS and Android libraries.
For solutions involving gateways, there is also gateway middleware that allows
to interface with devices connected to it. Leave communications to [DeviceHive]
and focus on actual product and innovation.

JavaScript framework is a wrapper around [DeviceHive RESTful protocol] that includes a set of methods to access corresponding [DeviceHive] resources.

#Components

##Client

This library could be a very good choice to quickly prototype an HTML client for your custom device. It could also be used in complex applications to enable interaction with the [DeviceHive] server from the client-side components. Check out [DHClient API Reference](#DHClient) to get information about all of the available fields and methods.

The library supports the following actions:

* Authenticate with login and password or with an access key.
* Get information about [DeviceHive] networks, devices and device classes
* Get current state of equipment that devices have onboard
* Get real-time notifications from devices about various events
* Send a command to a particular device

##Device

This library can be used on the Device side. Any device which support `javascript` can be connected with DeviceHive using this module. Check out [DHDevice API Reference](#DHDevice) to get information about all of the available fields and methods.
The library supports the following actions:

* Authenticate with a device key or with an access key.
* Register and update a device in the [DeviceHive] network
* Get information about the current device
* Get and update real-time commands from clients
* Send a notification to the cloud

#Compatibility

**Client** and **Device** libraries could be used in the following environments:

* Chrome
* Safari
* Firefox
* IE 10, 11

`Node.js` support will be added in future, but still you can leverage [DeviceHive] on `node` by workarounding transport related specifics. 
For example you can install a library which implements XMLHttpRequest and use only `longpolling` channel.

#Installation:

##Browser

Install package with bower:

```sh
$ bower install devicehive
```

or download package files from [`build\browser`](build/browser) folder. 

After that you should add references to your HTML file.

You can also use `JQuery` wrappers to utilize `Deferred`s instead of node-style callbacks.

#Usage

Create new instance of the `DHClient` or `DHDevice`

```js
// Create DHClient instance specifying login and password as an auth parameters
var dhClient = new DHClient("http://xxxxx.pg.devicehive.com/api", "login", "password");

// Create DHClient instance specifying access key as an auth parameter
var dhClient = new DHClient("http://xxxxx.pg.devicehive.com/api", "AccessKeyExampleAccessKeyExampleAccessKeyEx=");

// Create DHDevice instance specifying device id and device key as an auth parameters
var dhDevice = new DHDevice("http://xxxxx.pg.devicehive.com/api", "someDeviceId_123-456", "someCustomDeviceKey");

// Create DHDevice instance specifying device id and access key as an auth parameters
var dhDevice = new DHDevice("http://xxxxx.pg.devicehive.com/api", "someDeviceId_123-456", "AccessKeyExampleAccessKeyExampleAccessKeyEx=");
```

or if you want to use `Deferred`s use builders from `JQuery` object

```js
var dhClient = $.dhClient("http://xxxx.pg.devicehive.com/api", "login", "password");
```

After creating a new instance you will be able to get relevant information from the [DeviceHive] cloud

```js
// Use DHClient library to get information about devices registered in the cloud
dhClient.getDevices(null, function(err, devices){
    if(!err)
        doWork(devices);
});
```

also you can register devices and update data in the cloud

```js
// Use DHDevice library to register your device in the cloud.
// It will be registered with an id specified during DHDevice instance creation 
dhDevice.registerDevice({
    name: "My Device",
    // device key which can be used for device authentication.
    key: "some device key",
    // object with a description of the device class or existing device class id
    deviceClass: {
        name: 'My Device Class',
        version: '0.0.1',
        equipment: [
            { name: 'Example sensor', type: 'sensor', code: '1234' }
        ]
    }
}, function(err, res) {
    console.log(err ? 'failed' : 'success');
});
```

You can check [Core Implementation](src/core/devicehive.js), [DHClient Implementation](src/client/client.js) and [DHDevice Implementation](src/device/device.js) or read [DeviceHive RESTful protocol] reference to get more information about supported methods.

##Channels

The framework also implements a facility to continuously receive device notifications, send notification, receive client commands and send client commands.
These features utilizes WebSocket or HTTP long-polling mechanisms supported by [DeviceHive]. In order to provide that functionality, the library uses a concept of channels to transmit messages between the server and client. 
Clients and devices should simply open a channel, subscribe to messages and then handle them in the corresponding callback methods.

To open the channel

```js
dhClient.openChannel(callbackFunction, channelName)
```

Channel names are `websocket` and `longpolling`. If `channelName` is not passed then the first compatible channel will be opened.

You can also subscribe for a channel state changed event:

```js
// bind
var eventSubscription = dhClient.channelStateChanged(function(state){
    console.log(state.oldState);
    console.log(state.newState);
});

// unbind
eventSubscription.unbind();
```

After the channel is opened your clients will be able to interact with the devices in a real-time fashion. 

Take a look at this example for the **Client** library:

```js
// Open the channel for DHDevice instance
dhClient.openChannel(function(err) {
    if (err) return;

    // Send device command with custom parameters to the device with deviceId identifier
    var cmd = dhClient.sendCommand(deviceId, 'command_name', {
        someParameter: 'someValue'
    });

    // Do some work after the command is processed by the device with an id "deviceId"
    cmd.result(function(res) {
        doSomeWork(res);
    }, waitTimeout);

    // Start listening for notif1 and notif2 notifications from devices with deviceId1 and deviceId2 identifiers
    var options = {
        // optional device id or array of ids
        // if not specified subscription will be created for all devices
        deviceIds: [deviceId1, deviceId2],
        // optional notification name or array of names,
        // if not specified will listen for all notifications
        names: ['notif1', 'notif2']
    };
    // pass the callback as a first parameter and options as a second
    // if options object was not passed subscription will listen for all notifications for all devices
    var subscription = dhClient.subscribe(function(err, subscription) {
        if (!err)
            console.log('subscribed successfully')
    }, options);

    // add handler for the subscription which will be invoked when a new notification is received
    subscription.message(function(notification) {
        doSomeWork(notification);
    });

    // add as many handlers as you wish
    var handler = subscription.message(function(notification) {
        doSomeAdditionalWork(notification);
    });

    // and of course you can remove any handler
    handler.unbind();
});

// Close the channel for DHClient instance
dhClient.closeChannel();
```

Here is an example for the **Device** library:

```js

// Open the channel for DHDevice instance
dhDevice.openChannel(function(err) {
    if (err) return;

    // Send device notification with the custom parameters
    dhDevice.sendNotification('notification_name', {
        someParameter: 'someValue'
    });

    // Start listening for command1 and command2 sent by some client
    var options = {
        // optional command name or array of names,
        // if not specified will listen for all commands
        names: ['command1', 'command2']
    };
    // pass the callback as a first parameter and options as a second
    // if options object was not passed subscription will listen for all commands
    var subscription = dhClient.subscribe(function(err, subscription) {
        if (!err)
            console.log('subscribed successfully')
    }, options);

    // add handler for the subscription which will be invoked when a new command is received
    subscription.message(function(cmd) {
        var workResult = doSomeWork(cmd);

        // Update a received command so the client can be notified about the result
        cmd.update(workResult);
    });

    // add as many handlers as you wish
    var handler = subscription.message(function(notification) {
        doSomeAdditionalWork(notification);
    });

    // and of course you can remove any handler
    handler.unbind();
});

// Close the channel for DHDevice instance
dhDevice.closeChannel();
```
